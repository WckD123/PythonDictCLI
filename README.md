# Python Dictionary CLI

This is my first Python Project.

I have created a Python Command Line Interface based Dictionary.

This dictionary has the following basic features:

1) Enter the word -> You'll get its meaning
2) Upon entering a wrong word, the program will give you other words which are close to the original words.
3) A final Yes/No prompt will help you get the meaning of the suggested word or run the program again.

Note: I tried implementing this on my own but realized that the get_close_matches function of the "difflib" was the best option to do so. Hence, that has been used.
